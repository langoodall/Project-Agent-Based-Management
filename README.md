Overview of Research:

The United States is one of the world's leaders in timber production and the southeast is one the the nations top timber producing regions, primarily dealing in softwood derived products from species such as loblolly pine. Large scale, multi goal management is needed to craft forests that are able to meet the needs of an environmentally and economically uncertain future. The agent-based model SOSIEL Harvest Extension (SHE) of LANDIS-II is utilised to dechiper the most efficient and practical way to acheive one of three stated goals: total amount harvested, total amount of biomass, and percent mature cohorts. Generic, broad stroke prescriptions based upon typical silvicultural practices were designed for SHE to select from during the implementation process, which is chosen by each agent using SOSIEL's cognitive architecture that is capable of a number of decision making processes.

Anson, Montgomery and Richmond counties represent three of the top 10 counties in NC for their delivered value from 2022. Each of these counties is assigned a primary goal within which agents will harvest and learn. At each timestep the agents update their cognitive behaviour and begin implementing the next phase of management based upon what they have learned in the previous iteration of harvesting.
